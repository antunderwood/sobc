		<h2>First Sundays - 10.45 am</h2>
			Monthly event on the first Sunday of the month. Maybe a good place to start if you don't think that church is for you. Begins at 10:45 am with coffee & doughnuts or cakes.  The content of the next hour or so is varied. We attempt to be thought provoking and  challenging without being too heavy.<br><br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%">February:</span> Homelessness close to home (Watford New Hope Trust)<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%">March:</span> Fair Trade and Trade Justice<br><br>
			To give you an idea of the kind of topics we have looked at, here are some titles of 1st Sunday services in the past:
