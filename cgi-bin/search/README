Requirements

     * A webserver that lets you execute CGI scripts
     * Perl 5.004 or higher
     * DB_File 1.72 module ([14]Source/[15]ActiveState Perl) -- before
       you download it, try if Perlfect Search works without. DB_File may
       already be installed by default.
     * The following modules are only necessary if you want to fetch the
       pages you want to index via http. Note that some or all modules
       may already be installed on your system, so you should first try
       if it works without installation. If you are on Windows and you
       are using [16]ActivateState Perl you can install missing modules
       with [17]PPM: type ppm, then install <package_name>. Otherwise
       download the sources linked here (the version number is the
       minimum version, more recent versions should work, too):
          + [18]MIME::Base64 2.11
          + [19]Digest::MD5 2.20
          + [20]URI 1.10
          + [21]HTML::Tagset 3.03
          + [22]HTML::Parser 3.15
          + [23]LWP::libwww-perl 5.50
       If you have never before installed a Perl module you may want to
       read [24]How to install modules (or, alternatively, [25]Installing
       CPAN Modules).

Installation

   The easiest way to install Perlfect Search is to use the setup utility
   that comes with this distribution:
    1. Open the compressed archive you downloaded with a suitable
       compression tool (e.g. tar and gunzip for Linux/Unix, Winzip for
       Windows). A directory search-3.31 will be created with all the
       program files in it.
    2. Upload the directory to your account if it is hosted on a remote
       machine using FTP or scp (secure copy). Don't upload it inside
       your cgi-bin directory, rather put it in a temporary place. The
       setup utility will take care of copying everything in appropriate
       locations.
    3. Login to your account using ssh/telnet if it is on a remote
       system.
    4. Go inside the distribution directory that you just uploaded.
    5. Run the setup utility with the following command: perl setup.pl
    6. The setup utility will then guide you through the rest of the
       installation process.
    7. Go to the installation directory (e.g. cgi-bin/perlfect/search)
       and try to run perl indexer.pl.
    8. When everything works, you can delete the temporary search-3.31
       directory.

   If you have trouble running the setup utility, or if you prefer to
   manually install and configure the application for some reason, your
   best bet is to upload the entire directory somewhere in your cgi-bin,
   setting permissions of most files/dirs to world-readable
   world-executable (755 for Linux/Unix systems, note that only
   indexer.pl should be 700, setup.pl should be removed) and then
   modifying the file conf.pl with a text editor to match the setup of
   your site. If you install manually, then you probably know what you
   are doing and the configuration file conf.pl should be
   self-explanatory. If you don't know what you are doing then you
   shouldn't be installing manually!

   If you don't have telnet/ssh access to your server, you cannot use our
   automatic setup utility. You can still make all necessary changes to
   conf.pl on your local disk and then upload everything via FTP or scp.
   If you have done this before with some other CGI script this will be
   easy for you.

Indexing your site

   After the script has been installed, you will need to index your site
   in order to be able to perform searches.

   Most people want to index the files as they are on the server's disk,
   and this is what will happen by default. If your pages are generated
   dynamically (e.g. via PHP) you will want to index them via http. This
   is also important for security reasons, as dynamic files might contain
   passwords that should not be indexed in their source. To index dynamic
   pages, load conf.pl into an editor and set $HTTP_START_URL.

  Indexing using ssh/telnet

    1. Login to your account using ssh/telnet if it is on a remote
       machine.
    2. Go to the directory where the script was installed. The setup
       utility will have installed the script in a directory
       perlfect/search/ inside your cgi-bin directory.
    3. Run the indexer program with the command: perl indexer.pl and wait
       until it's finished.

  Indexing using a web browser

   If you cannot log into your server via telnet/ssh you can start the
   indexing process with your browser. This is less secure than logging
   in via ssh to start the indexer, so it should only be used if
   absolutely necessary. To do it, set a password at
   $INDEXER_CGI_PASSWORD in conf.pl. Then load the index_form.html HTML
   file into an editor and change the action attribute value of the
   <form> tag so that it points to your server. Load index_form.html with
   a browser, enter your password and submit the form. indexer.pl must be
   executable by your server for this, and the data and temp directories
   need to be writable, so you have to set the according permissions with
   your FTP program.

   Depending on how large your site is you will need to wait for some
   time while the indexer digests all of your site's content. If you stop
   the indexing (e.g. with Ctrl-C if you are in a shell) your index will
   not be updated. Perlfect Search will continue to use the old index.

Putting a search box on your pages

   The setup utility will have the search script installed inside your
   cgi-bin directory, in a subdirectory called perlfect/search/. So if
   your cgi-bin is at the URL http://mydomain.com/cgi-bin/ the location
   of the search script will be
   http://mydomain.com/cgi-bin/perlfect/search/search.pl. Point your
   browser to this url to see if it works. If the script has been
   installed correctly and an index has been successfully created using
   indexer.pl, this URL should return a results page for an empty query
   (i.e. a page that tells you there are no results).

   You can then use the following HTML code to insert the search box in
   any of your pages (or use search_form.html, which contains this code):
  <form method="get" action="/cgi-bin/perlfect/search/search.pl">
    <input type="hidden" name="p" value="1">
    <input type="hidden" name="lang" value="en">
    <input type="hidden" name="include" value="">
    <input type="hidden" name="exclude" value="">
    <input type="hidden" name="penalty" value="0">
    <select name="mode">
          <option value="all">Match ALL words</option>
          <option value="any">Match ANY word</option>
    </select>
    <input type="text" name="q"><input type="submit" value="Search">
  </form>

   You might have to change the form's action attribute to fit your local
   setup. Here's a list of the possible fields (note that the defaults
   are okay for most people, so you probably don't need to change
   anything):

   p
          This is an internal variable (for the current page), you should
          not change it.

   lang
          Use this attribute to set the language of the result page. The
          text strings for new laguages and the paths to the templates
          have to be added to conf.pl.

   include
          If you only want to search a part of all indexed files, you can
          limit the search to certain paths with this option. Example:
          /archive/ will exclude all files except those whose pathnames
          match "/archive/". You can also set a regular expression.
          Setting this to "" will search all files. Note: Do not use this
          to protect private files (see below).

   exclude
          If you want to exclude the files in certain paths, use this
          option. Example: /old_stuff/. This is evaluated after include,
          so you can restrict the set of files with include and then
          further restrict it with this option. You can also set a
          regular expression. Setting this to "" will not exclude any
          files. Note: Do not use this to protect private files, as
          anybody can change this option. To protect private/secret
          files, use conf/no_index.txt instead and re-index your files.

   penalty
          You can decrease the ranking of old documents with this option,
          i.e. they will appear more at the end of all matches. This may
          be useful for mailing list archives, where new articles are
          often more interesting. The value is a float number that sets
          the decrease in percent per age in days. Example: with 0.5 a
          100 days old document's ranking will be decreased by 50%. (Note
          that the calculation does not use the percentages you see in
          the result pages.) Even if a document's ranking is decreased to
          0%, it will still appear as a match. Your server should send a
          Last-modified header if you want to use this option and you
          index your pages via http. If it doesn't, the pages without
          this header will be regarded as very new (their date is "now").
          Often dynamically generated page lack the Last-modified header,
          but it depends on the contents of the page if it makes sense to
          regard the page as up-to-date.

   mode
          Set the default operator to all (logical AND) or any (logical
          OR). This sets how terms are connected if more than one term is
          entered by the user. It's just a default, users can still use
          +/- in front of their terms. If you don't want your users to
          see the selection, just make it a hidden field.

   q
          This is the name of the search field.

Customizing the results page

   Inside the directory where Perlfect Search was installed you will find
   a directory called templates and inside it there are the files
   search.html and no_match.html. You can open these files with your
   favourite text editor and edit them to customize the look of the
   results page. It is like a regular HTML file, but there are some
   comments in it that tell the Perlfect Search where to insert the
   dynamic results.

   The result pages are valid XHTML. Please support web standards and
   test the pages for correctness at [26]validator.w3.org if you make
   changes to them. (Note that the template files themselves are not
   valid XHTML, but the generated pages that show the result of a search
   are. To test a template, search for something, save the result page
   and upload that file to the validator.)

Highlighting matched terms

   Perlfect Search allows you to display the documents with all search
   terms highlighted. Each search result has a "highlight matches" link
   for that. This feature is limited to HTML pages that follow some
   simple restrictions:
     * Attribute values may not contain < or >, e.g. <img src="..."
       alt="<b>Picture</b>"> is forbidden
     * <script> and <style> sections need to be commented out. Example
       how to comment out <script>:
<script>
<!--
here comes the javascript
// -->
</script>

   If your documents don't follow these restrictions the pages may be
   displayed garbled. You should then disable this feature by setting
   $HIGHLIGHT_MATCHES = 0; in conf.pl. You can use @HIGHLIGHT_EXT to set
   which files have a "highlight matches" link. Usually these are just
   HTML files, including HTML files generated by PHP etc (only if
   $HTTP_START_URL is set), but not for PDF files etc.

   The "highlight matches" feature takes an URL as a parameter - still it
   will refuse to work on any URL that was not actually indexed. This is
   a security measure so people cannot just load any file from your
   server or view any URL on the web via your server.

Excluding directories or files from the index

  Local filesystem

   Inside the directory where Perlfect Search was installed you'll find a
   directory called conf and inside it there's a file called
   no_index.txt. Open it with your favourite text editor and add the
   paths of any files you want to exclude from indexing, one on each
   line. The use of the wildcard character * is supported, so for example
   a line containing:
/dir1/dir2/file.*

   will match any file in /dir1/dir2/ that starts with file.
   If you want to exclude a whole directory, use
/dir1/dir_to_exclude/*

   You need to run indexer.pl again after making changes to this file.

  Files fetched via http

   If you are using the $HTTP_START_URL option to fetch your files via
   http you can also exclude certain files from the index by adding this
   meta tag to their head: <meta name="robots" content="noindex">. The
   robots.txt file in the document root of your web server is also taken
   into consideration.

Searching

   Searching is really simple: Type in one ore more words into the search
   field and click "Search" (or press Return). If "Match ALL words" is
   selected, only those documents are returned which contain all of your
   search terms. With "Match ANY word" all documents are returned which
   contain at least one of your search terms. Alternatively you can put a
   plus sign (+) directly in front of one or more words to only get those
   files which include all of those words. Words with a minus (-) sign
   directly in front of them change the result so that only documents are
   listed which don't contain any of those words.

   Note that phrase searches are not supported, i.e. it doesn't make
   sense to put quotes around your query "like this".

   The results are ordered by relevance with the most relevant documents
   listed first. Relevance depends on the number and position of matched
   words in the documents.

   Read our [27]FAQ. There's a lot of interesting stuff about configuring
   and using Perlfect Search there, so don't leave it for tomorrow! You
   also might want to look at conf.pl ([28]example), there are many
   options that are not even mentioned in this documentation.
