<h2><span>Wednesday Whiz Kids</span></h2>
Wednesday Whiz Kids is a parent / carer and toddler group which runs in term time on a Wednesday morning from 9.30 am until 11am. It is a thriving group with about 20 or so adults and 25 to 30 children . The children range from young babies to 3 and 4 year olds. The children like to jump around on the soft play equipment , ride around on bikes , play in the Wendy house or ride on the rocking horse. They also enjoy dressing up and pretending to be firemen, policemen, builders or princesses. Others enjoy doing puzzles or colouring.Whilst all these activities are going on the parents and carers are enjoying chatting over tea and biscuits, whilst keeping a close eye on their children. There is a warm friendly atmosphere where friendships are being formed between the adults as they swap stories of highs and lows of family life and support each other. Special activities include our Christmas special: singing Christmas carols, acting out the Christmas story and there's even a visit from Santa. Other special events in the year include a mums pancake race, special crafts for Mother's Day and our Easter bonnet parade and egg hunt. </p>

Rainbow Kids Toddler Club is a parent / carer and toddler group which runs every Tuesday afternoon during term time only from 13.15pm until 15.00pm. It is a slightly structured play session for adults with children under the age of 5. Everyone is very welcome to join in with all of  the activities. The session generally starts with some free play, we then join together for some action songs followed by painting or sticking and more free play, half way through all the children are invited to sit down for a drink and biscuit and the adults have a cup of tea/coffee. Some more free play follows and the session ends with a joint tidy-away and a story. There are lots of table top activities for the children to enjoy, jigsaw puzzles, play dough, painting or sticking, colouring, counting, building and pretend play are all available. We have a special mat with toys for the very little ones and a corner for reading as well as lots of floor activities, cars, trains, bricks and blocks and of course dressing up and lots of pretend play.
