Known problems / TODO:

-visited links are not recognized by e.g. Mozilla because
 both "+" and "%20" can be used to escape a space (Mozilla
 uses "+", Perlfect Search uses "%20")
-redirected urls can be indexed twice (a second check after get_url() is needed)
-translated template files are not up-to-date
-"highlight matches" doesn't work with umlauts

WISHES:

-normalize config values wrt ending slash
-make the 65,000 files limit optional
-remove quotemeta in load_excludes() so that full regexp can be used?
-optionally use @EXT for http too (default to "yes"), so zip etc isn't downloaded at all
-make the template valid XHTML by allowing ##cgi: varname## or so
 (isn't completely possible anway, b/c of generated attributes)
-"Searched yyy for xxx": the stopwords should not appear here
 (??? google shows them, too)
-better test for visited links (hash for urls, another hash for md5 checksums?)
-test if @HTTP_CONTENT_TYPES option still works
-"use strict"
-fix "deep recursion" warning?!? perl warns if recursion > 100 :-(
-setup: automatically find pdftotext
-url rewriting function that can easily be modified by anybody
-make "follow symlink" optional
-make a case option (for http on windows servers)
-command line search always uses OR -> make an option?
-"in %.2f seconds" -> i18n
-general DEBUG info, not HTTP_DEBUG. show result of to_be_ignored() in indexer_filesystem.pl
-"getting the file '...' is not allowed": no highlighting (doesn't matter?)
