			        As I write this I have just finished watching Eastenders. Not my favourite programme - but one of my wife's so... it was on!<br/>
                    Dot Cotton (for anyone who doesn't know - an elderly lady who believes in God, quotes the bible, worries a lot, smokes almost as much, and who comes across as rather a sad character)... Dot Cotton has been chatting away to her tape recorder - giving a message to her husband, Jim, who is in hospital having had a stroke (so my wife tells me).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    She is reminiscing over her life, and most of it is filled with sadness. She struggles with why it is so hard to say, "I love you" to Jim. In the end she decides that it is because there wasn't a lot of love in her life. Her mum didn't want her around, and neither did the men that her mum had home. A few people in her life briefly gave her moments of happiness. Being evacuated as a child and staying with a kind aunt and uncle was the most powerful and hardest to lose. Her adult experience also lacked love. Disappointments and tragedies were all too common. And now people saw her as a grumpy old woman. Thankfully, she still had the hope of heaven. The future has got to be better than this. And I would say she was right.<br/>
                    <br/>
                     But somehow it seems, Dot and millions of real people all over, old and young, have missed out on experiencing God's love in a way that really makes all the difference here and now. And she (so the programme tells us) is a Christian!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    True, knowing you are loved by God doesn't make everything go the way we want always. It doesn't save you from the ups and downs of life. It doesn't even save you from experiencing human loneliness at times. But it connects you to one who is strong and kind, who is with you always, has made a way to be with you continually. One who wants you to have a sense of purpose, a peace on the inside, a sense of value: "You are someone." "You matter." And don't let anyone tell you different!<br/> 
                    <br/>
                    The thing is: this love is a gift, and like all gifts it can be received or rejected. Or if you don't know about the gift you can miss out.  If you've read this far, keep going - and then come and meet some people who have discovered the gift and receive it yourself.<br/>
                    <br/>
    				<b>God loves you.</b><br/>
                    Reading that is easy.<br/>
                    Believing it can be harder.<br/>
                    Missing out on the reality of it is a tragedy.<br/>
                    Believing it deep down, and living in the good of it has been the best thing ever for many people.<br/>
                    Join us as we share stories and experiences of what it means to be on the receiving end of the greatest love of all.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>God is love.</b><br/>
                    Is that true? Is that the God you believe in?<br/>
                    The Bible says it. But what does it mean anyway? How do you experience it?<br/>
                    We will be exploring this theme on Sunday mornings. My prayer is that we won't just be talking about it, but that God will show us, in our experience, deep in our hearts, what it means to know, receive, and embrace his love for us.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Not just sentimental love, but the forgiveness, kindness, affection, compassion and delight of the creator of all things. Not love that lasts for a moment on someone that has a passing attraction, but love that says that you are valued on good days and bad days, and lasts for eternity.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It's a love that says, "I choose you." "You are wanted and loved for who you are."<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It's a love that can reach you, and has reached many of us at church, when we didn't have much to offer. It's a love that says, "I will be there for you, no matter what you have done." "I want the best for you, I am ready to help you, to rescue you."<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It is a love that changes people's lives. Here and now. South Oxhey Baptist Church - 
    Sundays at 11am can be a place to discover it. You won't lose anything, you may discover the greatest gift of your life.
