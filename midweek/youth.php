		<b>The Max</b> is a fortnightly youth club that meets every other Wednesday, from 7pm to 9pm. Admission is free and the club is open to all young people in school years 7 and above.  Come and play table tennis, pool, table football and board games, or just hang out and chat with your friends. Learn why the Bible is relevant to your life during The Xchange - our 15-minute talk and discussion half way through the evening. Make some new friends as you team up for the group games.<br><br>
		Look forward to seeing you there!<br><br>
