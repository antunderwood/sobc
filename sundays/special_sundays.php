		<h2>Special Sundays - 10.45 am</h2>
			You are always welcome at any of our services, but these special  Sundays may be a good place to start if you are not used to church. Begins at 10:45 am with coffee & doughnuts or cakes.  The content of the next hour or so is varied. We attempt to be thought provoking and  challenging without being too heavy.<br><br>
			To give you an idea of the kind of topics we have looked at, here are some titles of 1st Sunday services in the past:

			<ul>
				<li><b>A personal story:</b> mother of two, member of SOBC, traveller to Africa and trainer of Bible translators.  Called by God to give up paid employment to help full-time in the process of local people throughout the world translating the Bible into their own language. </li>
				<li><!-- <img src="/images/mona_lisa.jpg" width="96" height="110" alt="Mona Lisa" /><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%"> -->Investigating the Da Vinci Code<!-- </span> --></li>
				<li>What's the point of being a Christian?</li>
				<li>The power of Money</li>
				<li>God's ultimate answer to evil</li>
				<li>We all need friends</li>

			 </ul>
