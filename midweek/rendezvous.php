	<p>
	Rendezvous is a group meeting on Mondays from 10:30-12.00 in Catherine House next to the church for older members and friends of the church. The main part of the morning is social where we have quizes, craft activities, presentations from organisiations such as Fair Trade. We also package and send out SOON leafelets which are Bible notes requested from many people all over the world. Every Christmas we make many shoe box parcels containing presents for children as part of a national effort organised by the charity "The Samaritans Purse". The morning is concluded by a 'thought for the day' which is usually given by one of our members.<br>
	Occaisionally we have trips to places such as Kew Gardens.
