We have lots of fun learning about Jesus and the Bible. The children enjoy lively songs with actions. We also have circle time and often have prayer times together We read Bible stories together which they also enjoy acting out, and they love dressing up.  We have colouring sheets based on our story for the week and usually have a craft activity. The children are keen and enthusiastic and so are the adults!</td>
