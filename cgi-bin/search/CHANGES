3.30 (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* added Italian stopwords (Davide Bortoli)
* use meta robot tags for local files, too (except nofollow) (bug found by Frank Naude)
* search.pl: don't remove newlines when highlighting a text file (bug found by Frank Naude)

3.30beta (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* search.pl: show documents with highlighted search terms, see 
  the README for some known limitations with some constructs in HTML
* search.pl: warn user if he searches for stopwords
* search.pl: optionally higher ranking for more recent documents (new form field "penalty")
* search.pl: optionally include/exclude files at search-time (new form fields "include", "exclude")
* search.pl: fixed emphasis of words with special characters in result page
* search.pl: can now be called from the command line like this: ./search.pl "term1 term2"
* indexer.pl: indexing speed improved 20-50%
* indexer.pl: Show number of excluded files (conf/no_index.txt)
* indexer.pl: Fixed a false "Cannot remove..." warning (Daniel Quappe)
* indexer.pl: XHTML meta tags correctly recognized now
* indexer.pl: correct size of PDF files (Cameron Moore)
* indexer.pl: always store correct title with HTML+PDF (Cameron Moore)
* indexer.pl: preparation for indexing more than one remote server - please don't use
  this yet, as robots.txt is not supported yet!!
* SGMLEntities.pl renamed to tools.pl
* French templates (Max Attems)
* Italian templates (Davide Bortoli)
* New English template with new layout and information about total number of documents
* The English templates are now valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional
* Store and display the last-modified date of the documents
* All scripts now *really* use the -w option (should have been in 3.20 but wasn't)

3.20 (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* indexer.pl can now be called via web, using index_form.html. You need
  to set $INDEXER_CGI_PASSWORD in conf.pl.
* URI::Escape not necessary anymore
* robot meta tags now work (but only for getting files via http!)
* Option $HTTP_MAX_PAGES to avoid the indexer running into an endless loop (only for 
  getting files via http)
* search.pl: fixed some warnings (Jim Hall)
* search.pl: ignore stopwords (David Turley)
* search.pl: don't escape characters twice when using indexer_web.pl (Matthias E. Zeitler)
* DB_File is now required, not just recommended
* uses less memory than 3.20beta

3.20beta (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* For more than one term, logical AND is now default. This can easily be changed to OR (which is 
  the old behaviour) by using a select box as shown in search_form.html.
  "Any words" = OR, "All words" = AND.
  +/- operators are still working, it's just the default that has changed.
* Added HTTP_* options to allow indexing of files via http. This is necessary if at least
  some of your pages' content is dynamically generated, e.g. via PHP. Please use this
  only on your own servers to avoid waste of bandwidth.
* Search speed for many documents (>1000) in combination with +/- operators *much* improved
* new option $LOW_MEMORY_INDEX: Indexing is now much faster. If the increased memory usage
  is a problem for you, set $LOW_MEMORY_INDEX = 1 to get the old behaviour.
* new options $CONTEXT_SIZE, $CONTEXT_EXAMPLES, $CONTEXT_DESC_WORDS: show context of matches.
  This requires a big index, so it's off by default.
* new option PERCENTAGE_RANKING: ranking is now by default shown as a percentage value
* new option $IGNORE_TEXT_START/END to completely exclude parts of documents
* new option $PDFTOTEXT to index PDF files with a PDF to ASCII tool like pdftotext
* new options $TITLE_WEIGHT, %H_WEIGHT to make titles/headlines have more "weight", i.e. lead 
  to a higher score
* new option $LOG to log queries. This defaults to off. It writes to data/log.txt, which has 
  to exist and must be writeable (setup.pl will *not* do that for you)
* new option $MULTIPLE_MATCH_BOOST to increase the score if more than one word is matched
  in a document (defaults to off)
* indexer.pl: file paths in conf/no_index.txt don't have to be absolute anymore
* indexer.pl: bugfix: meta tags now always recognised even if split to more than one line
* indexer.pl: hopefully fixed a bug where the result link always pointed to "/" (Windows only)
* indexer.pl/search.pl: inv_index_db is now much smaller (by using 16 bit integer for weight and document id)
* indexer.pl: trashed old index files are now deleted so they cannot confuse indexer.pl
* search.pl: filenames are now escaped with URI::Escape
* search.pl/templates: file sizes are now remembered and included on the results page
* templates/no_match(_de).html: special page with tips if no matches were found
* better documentation of source code

3.10 (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* SECURITY fix in search.pl: no more cross site scripting attacks possible

3.09 (Daniel Naber <daniel.naber@t-online.de>):
* setup.pl: Bugfixes: other filetypes had no quotes, filetypes y/n answer not recognized, typo fixed
* setup.pl: security: indexer.pl now only executable by owner after installation
* setup.pl: conf.pl is loaded and modified (instead of repeating the contents of conf.pl in setup.pl)
* indexer.perl/conf.pl: applied weight-meta-alt-headline-filename.diff:
  -Perlfect Search now does not only show the meta description on the result page but takes it as content,
   so you can search for meta 'description' ('keywords' and 'author', too)
  -You can weight the meta, title and headline tags
  -Images' alt="..." values are now also treated as content
  -Optionally, the document's URL can be treated as content so you can search for filenames (but as
   for any text, no special characters like '/' etc are indexed). 
* indexer.pl: don't get confused by html tags inside comments
* indexer.pl/search.pl/SGMLEntities.pl: handle umlauts and accented characters correctly
* search.pl: should now work with mod_perl (to use tainting, see the comment in search.pl)
* search.pl/conf.pl: i18n: you can now have one results template for every language you support,
  templates/search_de.html is an example
* search.pl/indexer.pl/setup.pl: should now work better under Windows NT, e.g. DB hashes get untied()'d
  before they're deleted. Also see the comments in search.pl. setup.pl can now copy files under Windows
  thanks to File::Copy

3.08:
* indexer.pl: Use temporary df files while creating a new index. This way the old index is available for searching (Dobrica Pavlinusic).
* indexer.pl: $step cannot be less than 1. (Dobrica Pavlinusic).
* indexer.pl: New stopwords mechanism. Create one regex instead of matching each stopword individually (Ned Konz).
* indexer.pl: Hoisted repeated DB access out of the per-word loop in main::weights (Ned Konz).
* indexer.pl: Faster regex's for normalize including proper splicing for hyphenated words (Ned Konz).
* indexer.pl: Optional indexing of numbers by setting of $INDEX_NUMBERS in conf.pl.
* indexer.pl: Remove carriage returns (\r) when loading conf/* files. (Thomas Shaun)
* indexer.pl: Add installation directory to @INC so that the script can be invoked for different dirs. (David Fuentes)
* conf.pl: Added $INDEX_NUMBERS configuration variable.
* search.pl: New normalize() with faster regex's including proper splicing of hyphenated words (Ned Konz).
* search.pl: Add installation directory to @INC so that the script can be invoked for different dirs. (David Fuentes)

3.05:
* search.pl: Ignore stemming if $STEMCHARS == 0; otherwise any search would return 0 matches.

3.04:
* search.html : renamed it to search_form.html not to be confused with the template file.
* search.pl : Changed 'tie' statements to tie to AnyDBM_File objects instead of DB_File objects.
* setup.pl: Now the default $STEMCHARS is zero which ignores stemming altogether.

3.03:
* indexer.pl: Optimizations in the normalize() function(replacing s/// by equivalent tr///).
* indexer.pl: Replaced the stem() function by inline substr.

3.02:
* search.pl: Changed the flags used to tie the db files from O_NONBLOCK to O_RDONLY.
* conf.pl: Moved the $VERSION variable to the conf.pl file.
* indexer.pl: Fixed typo O_NONBLOBK to O_NONBLOCK.

3.01: 
* search.pl: used DB_File instead of AnyDBM_File which caused problems on
  machines that didn't have DB_File installed. This has been fixed.
* conf.pl: Added useful comments in conf.pl for people configuring the script
  manually.
* indexer.pl: Remove tf_db and df_db after indexing to free up space.
