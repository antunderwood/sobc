<h2><span>More about us</span></h2>
The best way to find out about us is by coming along in person, but this section should give you an idea who we are and what is important to us. 

We have a growing congregation that is full of variety in many ways, including age, background and life experience. On a typical Sunday we have an average of around 70 people. About half of these are members and around 20 are children and young people. 

<h3>Our purpose</h3>
<p>
We believe that God is calling us to be 'a welcoming community of people with Jesus Christ at the centre who love God, love one another and love the lost.'  We have adopted this statement as our purpose statement. We believe that it sums up much that is at the heart of what a church should be. It is rooted in the Bible. Some parts of the New Testament In time we will explore what this means to us in a section on this website.

<h3>Our Values</h3>
<p>
Values speak of things that we hold dear and seek to live by. Three values are particularly important to us: people matter to God; people need Jesus Christ; people can change. We believe these are especially meaningful in an area where a substantial number of people feel they have been forgotten, have been badly treated or are stuck in difficult situations.

Many other values inform our beliefs and practice. Among the most significant are the importance of the Bible and the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the church and of each person.
